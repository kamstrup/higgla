   * Java 6+


  SPECIAL NOTICE FOR JAVA 6
  The Higgla runtime depends on Juglr, which in turn depends on
  Doug Lea's Fork/Join framework also known as JSR166. This is
  scheduled to be part of Java 7, but is not going to enter Java 6.
  For this reason Higgla ships a stand alone jsr166.jar as found
  on http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/index.html.
  Since JSR166 adds classes to the java namespace you have to
  include it in your boot classpath with -Xbootclasspath/p:jsr166.jar
  when using Higgla with Java 6.
