  LEGAL NOTICE

  RUNNING HIGGLA
  Simply running the shell script higgla.sh without any arguments will start
  the Higgla server in you current working directory listening on port 4567.
  To check that it's working you can visit http://localhost:4567/ping/store/
  in you browser. It should say something like:

    "/2 says hi!"

  To store a document in Higgla you can use the 'curl' command line tool,
  which is standard on most unix systems, like so:

    curl http://localhost:4567/actor/store/ -d \
    '{ "__base__" : "books", 
        "__store__" : [
          {
            "__id__" : "book_1",
            "__rev__" : 0,
            "title" : "Dive Into Python",
            "myfield" : ["a", "list", "indeed"]
          }
        ]
    }'

  DEPENDENCIES
   * juglr >= 0.2.1
   * lucene-core > 3.0.0
   * jsr166 (for Juglr)
   * Java 6+

  SPECIAL NOTICE FOR JAVA 6
  The Higgla runtime depends on Juglr, which in turn depends on
  Doug Lea's Fork/Join framework also known as JSR166. This is
  scheduled to be part of Java 7, but is not going to enter Java 6.
  For this reason Higgla ships a stand alone jsr166.jar as found
  on http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/index.html.
  Since JSR166 adds classes to the java namespace you have to
  include it in your boot classpath with -Xbootclasspath/p:lib/jsr166.jar
  when using Higgla with Java 6.
