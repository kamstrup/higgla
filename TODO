TODO for Higgla
---------------

 * Optimize querying by caching the index reader+searcher
 * Allow indexing and querying of nested objects by concatenating field names
   with '#', '/', or some other suitable character
 * Alternative indexing of documents:
  - Allow verbatim/keyword fields by having a __keys__ list, just like
    the __index__ list currently used
 * Consider if/how to do sorting
