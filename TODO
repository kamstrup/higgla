TODO for Higgla
---------------

 * Optimize writing by caching the IndexWriter
 * Optimize querying by caching the index reader+searcher
 * Pass all string members in query templates through a StandardAnalyzer
   and join an AND query over the tokens - or possibly simply use a standard
   Lucene QueryParser on string members
 * Allow indexing and querying of nested objects by concatenating field names
   with '#', '/', or some other suitable character
 * Implement document versioning
 * Alternative indexing of documents:
  - Allow verbatim/keyword fields by having a __keys__ list, just like
    the __index__ list currently used
 * Consider if/how we do paging of large result sets
 * Consider if/how to do sorting
 * Consider if/how to do prefix queryies and negations
